# Phase_Transfer_Entropy
A Matlab File for the estimation of Phase Transfer Entropy

 Phase Transfer Entropy as described in:
 M Lobier, F Siebenhuhner, S Palva, JM Palva (2014) Phase transfer entropy: a novel phase-based measure for directed connectivity in networks coupled by oscillatory interactions. Neuroimage 85, 853-872
 Normalization , binning and delay have slightly difference from the original definition.
