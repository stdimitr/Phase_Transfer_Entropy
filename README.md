# Phase_Transfer_Entropy
A Matlab File for the estimation of Phase Transfer Entropy

%% Phase Transfer Entropy as described in:
%% M Lobier, F Siebenhuhner, S Palva, JM Palva (2014) Phase transfer entropy: a novel phase-based measure for directed connectivity in networks coupled by oscillatory interactions. Neuroimage 85, 853-872
%% with implemementation inspired by Java code by C.J. Stam (https://home.kpn.nl/stam7883/brainwave.html)
%% Note that implementations differ in normalisation, as well as choices for binning and delay
